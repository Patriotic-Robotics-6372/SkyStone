This folder contains the latest, newest, possibly untested code. Having separate folders for Stable and CuttingEdge is important because if I want to make changes with the Stable code, it could mess up the program, and if we only have one file that's the stable one, then it wastes time undoing the changes I made. So instead, I'm going to make changes in a different file, that way the original file is still going to work while also being able to experiment with new things. And when those new things work as intended, they can be pushed onto Stable.
