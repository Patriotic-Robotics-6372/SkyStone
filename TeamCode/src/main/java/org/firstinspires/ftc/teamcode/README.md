## Patriotic Robotics Code

Workflow:

1) Code starts in CuttingEdge
- Tests are made to CuttingEdge program
- If it works, push to Stable
2) Stable programs
- To be used in competition
- Should always work as intended
- Should not be touched
- If changes are made, move program back to CuttingEdge
3) Code becomes deprecated
- Stable programs get updated; old versions are pushed to deprecated
- Does not mean they're useless; they can be revisited / reused some other time
