The code here is known to work. 
This code should be used in official competitions (besides Tests, but even then, it's still considered Stable as it works.)
When changes are made to files here, the new file must go into CuttingEdge until it is fully tested. 
Only a few programs should appear here. When a CuttingEdge program passes tests and works, it goes into Stable and the old Stable code goes into Deprecated.
